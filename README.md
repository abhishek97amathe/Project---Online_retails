# Project---Online_retails
 The dataset is a comprehensive transaction record of all sales made by a UK-based online retailer from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011. The project focuses on preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, detecting outliers, and creating visualizations to uncover insights.
